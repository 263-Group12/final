# Lists of Resources and Such

This project utilized React (bootstrapped with Create-React-App)
, [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
which is a library for utilizing ThreeJs within React. We consulted the React-Three-Fiber documentation, and youtube
videos like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU).
</br> We also consulted a number of articles and such to identify issues with different aspects of our build. For
instance, Netlify oddly sometimes doesn't like %s for opacity. Otherwise, we did not use outside resources nor consult
other students.
</br> It would be impractical to list all the different html tags and css used within the project. The main html and css
related module used in this project was [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) which is a React component library for
building responsive website easily.
